# Assignment 1: Recursion, Datatypes and Higher Order Functions (400 points)

## Overview

The overall objective of this assignment is to get some
experience using the *core* features of functional programming,
namely, Recursion, Datatypes and Higher-Order functions.

The assignment is in the following files that you will modify

- [List.hs](/src/CSE230/List.hs)
- [Shapes.hs](/src/CSE230/Shapes.hs)
- [Doc.hs](/src/CSE230/Doc.hs)
- [Directory.hs](/src/CSE230/Directory.hs)

Finally, `Test.hs` has some sample tests to be used
to check your assignments before submitting.

- [test/Test.hs](/test/Test.hs)

You should **only modify** the parts of the files which say:

```haskell
error "fill this in"
```

with suitable Haskell implementations.

**You are free to write and use any helper functions.**

## Instructions

### Assignment Testing and Evaluation

Most of the points, will be awarded automatically, by
**evaluating your functions against a given test suite**.

[Tests.hs](/tests/Test.hs) contains a very small suite
of tests which gives you a flavor of of these tests.
When you run

```shell
$ make test
```

Your last lines should have

```
All N tests passed (...)
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**or**

```
K out of N tests failed
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**If your output does not have one of the above your code will receive a zero**

If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile,
leave it as is with the `error "fill me in"` with your
partial solution enclosed below as a comment.

The other lines will give you a readout for each test.
You are encouraged to try to understand the testing code,
but you will not be graded on this.

### Submission Instructions

To submit your code, just do:

```bash
$ make turnin
```

If you are working in a group, make sure to update the file `COLLABORATORS.md`
with your group members, but **each person must submit on their own**.

## Problem 1: Lists

### Cloning

Fill in the implementation of `clone` such that `clone n x` returns
a list of `n` copies of `x`. When you are done, you should see the
following behavior:

```haskell
>>> clone 5 'a'
"aaaaa"

>>> clone 3 "cat"
["cat","cat","cat"]
```

### Padding

Fill in the implementation of `pad` such that `pad dir n x ys`
"pads" the list `ys` with as many copies of `x` as needed to make
it exactly of size `n`. The `dir` parameter specifies whether the
copies of `x` should be added at the beginning (`DirL`) or at the
end (`DirR`).

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> pad DirL 10 0 [1,2,3,4,5]
[0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5]

>>> pad DirR 10 0 [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0,0,0]

>>> pad DirL 3 0 [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]

>>> pad DirR 3 0 [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Sub-Sequence

Fill in the definition of `isSubsequence` such that
`isSubSequence s1 s2` returns True if `s1` can be
obtained by *deleting* some elements of `s2`.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> isSubSequence "cat" "dog"
False

>>> isSubSequence "cat" "craptasticdog"
True
```

### Maximum

Fill in the implementation of `maximum` so that `maximum d xs`
returns the largest of `d:xs`.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> maximum 99 []
99

>>> maximum 99 [90, 100, 200, 52]
200
```

### Intersperse

Fill in the definition of `intersp` such that
`intersp s [x1,x2,...,xn]` returns the list
`[s, x1, s, x2, s, ..., xn, s]`.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> intersp '|' "chewbacca"
"|c|h|e|w|b|a|c|c|a|"

>>> intersp "yo!" ["which", "way", "is", "the", "park"]
["yo!","which","yo!","way","yo!","is","yo!","the","yo!","park","yo!"]
```

### `iter`

Fill in the definition of `iter` such that `iter n f x`
returns the result of calling `f` on `x` exactly `n` times, e.g.

- `iter 3 f x` returns `f (f (f x))`, and
- `iter 5 f x` returns `f (f (f (f (f x))))`.

When you are done you should get the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> iter 10 (\x -> 2 * x) 1
1024
```

## Problem 2: Shapes

### Rainbow

Fill in the implementation of `rainbow` so that when you
are done, running

```haskell
>>> mkRainbow
```

creates a file `img/rainbow.png` that looks identical to

![Rainbow](/out/rainbow.png)

**HINT:** Read the documentation for `overlay` and `circle` from
the [`Graphics.Htdp` library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/htdp-image-1.1.0.0/docs/Graphics-Htdp.html).

### ChessBoard using `iter`

Fill in the implementation of `chessBoard2` so that when you
are done, running

```haskell
>>> mkChess2
```

creates a file `img/chess2.png` that looks identical to

![Chess Board](/out/chess2.png)

**HINT:** Make sure you understand the API in `chessBoard1`.

### Triangle using recursion

Fill in the implementation of `triRec` so that when you
are done, running

```haskell
>>> mkTriangle1
```

creates a file `img/triangle1.png` that looks identical to

![Chess Board](/out/triangle1.png)

**HINT:** You may find the `Graphics.Htdp` functions `above` and `beside` useful.

### Triangle using `iter`

Fill in the implementation of `sierpinskiTriangle2` so that when you
are done, running

```haskell
>>> mkTriangle2
```

creates a file `img/triangle2.png` that looks identical to

![Chess Board](/out/triangle2.png)

**HINT:** Make sure you understand the relation between `iter` and recursion.

### Carpet with `iter`

Fill in the implementation of `sierpinskiCarpet` so that when you
are done, running

```haskell
>>> mkCarpet
```

creates a file `img/carpet.png` that looks identical to

![Chess Board](/out/carpet.png)

## Problem 3: Documents

For this problem you will write a simple document layout engine, that allows the pretty printing of nested documents.

Thus, a document is a list of lines, each of which is a string. For example, the document

```
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
```

is represented as

```haskell
>>> D ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]
```

We have also provided implementations of methods for computing

* the `height` of a document (the number of lines)
* the `width` of a document (the maximum number of characters in a line)

### Vertical Concatenation aligned at Left

Fill in the implementation of `vcatL` such that `vcatL d1 d2`
*vertically concatenates* the documents `d1` and `d2` aligning
their *left* sides.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> (doc "cat") `vcatL` (doc "horse") `vcatL` (doc "mongoose")
cat
horse
mongoose
```

### Vertical Concatenation aligned at Right

Fill in the implementation of `vcatR` such that `vcatR d1 d2`
*vertically concatenates* the documents `d1` and `d2` aligning
their *right* sides.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> (doc "cat") `vcatR` (doc "horse") `vcatR` (doc "mongoose")
     cat
   horse
mongoose
```



### Horizontal Concatenation aligned at Top

Fill in the implementation of `hcatT` such that `hcatT d1 d2`
*horizontally concatenates* the documents `d1` and `d2` aligning
their *top* sides.


Suppose you have the following `Doc` values:

```haskell
>>> aDoc
a
aaa
aaaaa
```

```haskell
>>> bDoc
b
bbb
```

```haskell
>>> lineDoc
<----- HERE
```

When you are done with `hcatT`, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> hcatT aDoc lineDoc
a    <----- HERE
aaa
aaaaa
```

and

```haskell
>>> hcatT aDoc bDoc
a    b
aaa  bbb
aaaaa
```


### Horizontal Concatenation aligned at Bottom

Fill in the implementation of `hcatB` such that `hcatB d1 d2`
*horizontally concatenates* the documents `d1` and `d2` aligning
their *bottom* sides.


When you are done you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> hcatB aDoc lineDoc
a
aaa
aaaaa<----- HERE
```

and

```haskell
>>> hcatB aDoc bDoc
a
aaa  b
aaaaabbb
```

## Problem 4: `htree`

Finally, we will use `Doc` to build a command-line tool
called `htree` which does two tasks.

*1. Showing the Sub-Directories*

At the shell, executing

```
$ htree -ls src
```

produces the following tree-representation of the `src`
directory (of this repo).

```
src
├── CSE230
│   ├── Directory.hs
│   ├── Doc.hs
│   ├── Graphics.hs
│   ├── List.hs
│   └── Shapes.hs
├── Htdp
│   ├── Combinator.hs
│   ├── Data
│   │   └── Image.hs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Shape.hs
└── Main.hs
```

*2. Finding Files Matching a Pattern*

At the shell, executing

```
$ htree -find src .hs
```

prints out the list of all the files (recursively) inside `src`
that match the substring `.hs`:

```
src/CSE230/Directory.hs
src/CSE230/Doc.hs
src/CSE230/Graphics.hs
src/CSE230/List.hs
src/CSE230/Shapes.hs
src/Htdp/Combinator.hs
src/Htdp/Data/Image.hs
src/Htdp/Shape.hs
src/Main.hs
```

### Directories

We represent a *directory* via a datatype

```haskell
data Dir a
    = Fil a             -- ^ A single file named `a`
    | Sub a [Dir a]     -- ^ A sub-directory name `a` with contents `[Dir a]`
```

For example, the files in the `src` directory can be represented as:

```haskell
srcDir :: Dir FilePath
srcDir = Sub "src"
         [ Sub "CSE230" [ Fil "Directory.hs"
                        , Fil "Doc.hs"
                        , Fil "Graphics.hs"
                        , Fil "List.hs"
                        , Fil "Shapes.hs"
                        ]
         , Sub "Htdp" [ Fil "Combinator.hs"
                      , Sub "Data" [ Fil "Image.hs" ]
                      , Fil "README.md"
                      , Fil "Shape.hs"
                      ]
         , Fil "Main.hs"
         ]
```

### `dirDoc`

Fill in the implementation of `dirDoc` that converts a `Dir FilePath`,
i.e. a directory where each name is a `FilePath` (i.e. `String`) into
a `Doc` value (from the previous problem). Your code should only use
the *exported* functions of the `Doc` module, i.e.

* the `doc` constructor, and
* the combinators `hcatT`, `hcatB`, `vcatL` and `vcatR`.

**HINT:** You may find `dash`, `stile` , `angle` and `bar` useful.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> dirDoc srcDir
src
├── CSE230
│   ├── Directory.hs
│   ├── Doc.hs
│   ├── Graphics.hs
│   ├── List.hs
│   └── Shapes.hs
├── Htdp
│   ├── Combinator.hs
│   ├── Data
│   │   └── Image.hs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Shape.hs
├── Htdp.hs
└── Main.hs
```

```

### `allFiles`

Understand and use `foldDir` to fill in the implementation
of `allFiles dir` which returns a list of *all the files*
in the directory `dir`.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> allFiles example
["COLLABORATORS.md","LICENSE","Makefile","README.md","cse230-tree.cabal","carpet.png","chess1.png","chess2.png","rainbow.png","triangle1.png","triangle2.png","Directory.hs","Doc.hs","Graphics.hs","List.hs","Shapes.hs","Combinator.hs","Image.hs","README.md","Shape.hs","Htdp.hs","Main.hs""stack.yaml"]
```


### `allDirs`

Understand and use `foldDir` to fill in the implementation of
`allDirs dir` which returns a list of *all the sub-directories*
in the directory `dir`.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> allDirs example
[".","out","src","CSE230","Htdp","Data"]
```


### `findFiles`

Understand and use `foldDir` to fill in the implementation of
`findFiles sub dir` which returns a list of *all the files*
in the directory `dir` such that `sub` is a *subsequence*
of the files' names.

When you are done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
>>> findFiles ".hs" example
["./src/CSE230/Directory.hs","./src/CSE230/Doc.hs","./src/CSE230/Graphics.hs","./src/CSE230/List.hs","./src/CSE230/Shapes.hs","./src/CSE230/Directory.hs","./src/Htdp/Combinator.hs","./src/htdp/Data/Image.hs","./src/Htdp/README.md","./src/htdp/Shape.hs","./src/Htdp.hs","./src/Main.hs"]

```

### `build`

Finally, complete the implementation of the function
`build path` that recursively traverses the filesystem
starting at `path` to build the `Dir FilePath` object
describing the filesystem's contents at `path`. (You
can ignore complexities like symbolic links etc.)

When you are done, you should see the following
behavior (assuming you have not added extra files
in your `src/` directory!)

```haskell
>>> build "src"
Sub "src" [Sub "CSE230" [Fil "Directory.hs", Fil "Doc.hs", Fil "Graphics.hs", Fil "List.hs", Fil "Shapes.hs"], Sub "Htdp" [Fil "Combinator.hs", Sub "Data" [Fil "Image.hs"], Fil "README.md", Fil "Shape.hs"], Fil "Htdp.hs", Fil "Main.hs"]
```

Notice that the directories and files are listed in lexicographic order!

Finally, at this point, `stack install` should build and
install a standalone executable `htree` that you can then
run as described above:

```
$ htree -ls   src
```

and

```
$ htree -find src .hs
```
